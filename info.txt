parser 
	- gets list of domains

associator 
	- objects with each domain (png, etc.)
	- {"valid", "exception" : {"domain" : {objects} } }

cleaner
	- http is sloppy
	- look for easy extensions (/etc/img/___.jpg)
	- adds "preferred" to dictionary for each domain

analyzer
	- real work is done
	- check if supports IPv6 (DNS lookup)
	- adds "6support" to dictionary
	- pulls out IPv6 addresses

_A : associated
_C : cleaned
_D : DNS lookup
_T : traced and timed (analyzed)

hoping object fits in one packet
